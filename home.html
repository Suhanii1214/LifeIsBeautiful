                <a href="https://commonslibrary.org/by/helen-cox/">By Helen Cox</a>
                <p>As with other analyses, we have trawled through the responses to identify common themes as well as outlying ideas or novel approaches to sustainable activism – needless to say there is a diversity of approaches included. This is a long article full of the rich wisdom of nearly 200 activists! To summarise, people are doing the following to sustain themselves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saying no or limiting involvement with groups and campaigns</li>
                    <li>Getting good exercise, sleep, and nutrition</li>
                    <li>Practising mindfulness and meditation</li>
                    <li>Building emotional resilience and self-awareness</li>
                    <li>Fostering creativity and spirituality</li>
                </ul>

And we go between them like a see-saw, moving fluidly and flexibly as our needs shift and change.</p>
